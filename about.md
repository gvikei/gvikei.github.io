Hello. 

My name is Khuyen (/'kwi:n/) and I'm from Saigon, Vietnam. At the age of 10, I started learning computer programming by making applications with Visual Basic. As I discovered the beauty and the power of technology, I immediately fell for it and decided to dive more into the field. My decision to pursue a higher education in Computer Science in the US came as a consequence, and I have lived here for a little over 3 years.

Since my arrival in 2013, I was fortunate to work as a Research Assistant on an Android project while at Oklahoma State University, to intern at Google in Ads then Google Play department for 2 consecutive summers, and to come work for CHILI Lab - Ecole Polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland as a Research Intern.

I'm particularly into using Computer Science to address social issues on a large scale. Besides, I'm also interested in Psychology, Literature and Religion. 

Last words, I'm looking forward to the next opportunities to learn and to contribute to meaningful projects.
