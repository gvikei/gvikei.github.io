title: Week 1 - Back to school!
---

I had always wanted to have a personal space online where I can share and discuss things that I think areinteresting. However, due to privacy concerns, I had put off this idea for so long and instead kept a private blog for myself.

Fortunately, thanks to the CS373 (Software Engineering) course that I'm taking at school, I will be writing and publishing entries here weekly as to fulfill its requirements. My main focus for this blog will be the (technical) pieces of knowledge that I've learned in the class, at school, on the Internet, and from other people. 


## My expectations of the class ##

Since: 

```
happiness = reality / expectation
```

I intentionally don't have any expectations for the class.

Just kidding though.

I've heard good reviews of this class from past students so my hopes are pretty high. More importantly, looking at the syllabus, I feel like I will be learning a ton of things that I'm very interested in, such as full-stack development, software design and algorithmic problem solving. Thus, at the of the day, I hope I will come out of the class informed and happy.

My experience of the class
---

This class goes much faster than I imagined. 

The intro day wasn't too bad. However, starting from the second day, I was surprised that professor Downing went from Docker fundamentals to Assertions within an hour. 

Even though what was taught in the class isn't too hard to grasp, much of the Docker stuff doesn't really make sense until one has actually worked with it. Thus, I feel like introducing a whole bunch of Docker commands to those who have never touched Docker could be quite overwhelming. 

Apart from that, I found Assertions to be pretty cool, especially when I've only used them for unit testing. I'll try to make use of them more in my side-projects and hopefully more bug-free lines of code will be produced in less time. 

Tips of the week

Since my main focus for this semester is full-time job search, I'll be giving away my 2 cents on this topic.

1. If you are getting bored of grinding problems on [Leetcode](www.leetcode.com), give [Firecode](http://www.firecode.io) a try. I personally find solving problems on this site to be more fun. It first tests your knowledge and skills, before giving you a personalized study plan that matches your background and helps you advance to the next level pretty seamlessly. The problems are similar to those of Leetcode: concise and high-quality, which is also a plus. 

2. Having trouble finding where to get (high-quality) mock interviews? I would highly recommend [Refdash](http://www.refdash.com) over other free platforms that I've used, such as [Pramp](www.pramp.com) or [InterviewBit](www.interviewbit.io). 
What sets Refdash apart from the rest is the quality of the interviewers. Graduating from schools like Harvey Mudd or MIT and having lots of experience interviewing candidates for tech companies such as Google, they give very solid feedback (both verbal and written) on the interview performance and advice on how to improve from there. You won't be left in the dark not knowing where you did wrong as with other interviews. And if you happen to do well, they'll fast track you to on-sites with a bunch of tech companies!

3. Another resource that I found to be super useful for full-time job search is [Triplebyte](http://www.triplebyte.com). It's a recruiting platform that aims to provide a more unbiased hiring process for everyone. Regardless of what your background is (aka no resume needed), this site will assess your programming skills via a (pretty challenging yet interesting) quiz, then interview you before sending you to on-site interviews with companies that it partners with.
