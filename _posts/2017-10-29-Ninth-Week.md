"What I've done"? 
---

The beginning of the week, I was in Seattle for one of my on-sites. I didn't come back to Austin until Tuesday evening and went straight to the lab working on my AI project, which was due the same night.

The next day, I worked on the front-end of the IDB website, mostly focusing on pulling live data from the back end and to linking all models together. This wasn't the hard part, but it did take a lot of time as the Javascript syntax was more tricky than I thought. Apart from that, I also tried various ways to deploy the front-end server on GCP. 

Right now, I'm in Houston for another on-site and feeling quite bad about missing our class tomorrow.

What's in my way?
---

Right now I'm debating whether to cancel an on-site with a company, now that I've had an offer which I'm probably going to take. Since the flights and the hotel have been booked already, I'm just scared to tell the recruiter that I won't be going and just wasting their money. 

On the other hand, I do really want to schedule the on-site with Google before my current offer expires. However, at the same time, all the guilts and worries eat me up when I think about the (attendance) grades, the materials that I'm missing, and especially the workload that I won't be sharing with my teammates.

Plan for next week
---

Probably talk to the professors and someone who has been in this situation before, then start on my projects early and revisit the stuff that I miss.


My experience of the class
---

I didn't know there were so many kinds of joins in SQL, and it's fascinating to learn about 'em all.

Also, I've been having so many troubles with GCP that I've developed a bitter feeling for it now.

Tips of the week

I found the picture below to be quite helpful in terms of learning the differences between different types of joins. Hope it helps you as well!
