"What I've done"? 
---

I've skipped class too much due to interviews. Before, when all I yearned for were on sites, I didn't realize how bad can be having multiple in a short amount of time get. I didn't have enough time to focus on anything, be it absorbing class materials, studying for exams, working on projects or even the preparing the interviews. I'm really stressed out because of how much of the class I've missed out on and also because of my grades. 

What's in my way?
---

Project 3 is being due soon and I'm still out of town and won't be back until Tuesday. Also, I have another project due that day, so I'm so worried if I can get everything done on time.

Plan for next week
---

Sleep. Work. Pray. Repeat.

My experience of the class
---

Recently we've spent some time examining different join functions. While I think these are fun to learn, I don't quite get the big picture of why we need to write our own things in Python aka what are the use cases of what've been doing in class. 

Tips of the week

This week, I want to share with you [Farewell, App Academy. Hello, Airbnb](https://haseebq.com/farewell-app-academy-hello-airbnb-part-i/) - the story of a UT alumnus who majored in English and was a poker player for a while before getting Software Engineering jobs at Google and Airbnb,  despite lots of rejections at the beginning. I personally enjoyed this story and I hope you'll gain some valuable insights upon reading it as well.
