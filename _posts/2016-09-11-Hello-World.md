title: Starting off blogging again!
---

I had always wanted to have a personal space online that I can share and discuss with people about things that I find to be interesting. However, due to privacy concerns, I put off this idea for so long and instead kept a private blog for my own.

Recently, my friend [Eric Lee](https://thecreedo.github.io/) showed me his Github-based blog that he created for a class. It for sure inspired me to do produce something similar, and is also a good way to practice writing as well as keeping track with materials at school. I will dedicate this blog to mainly what I learn from my classes, CS and non-CS included. Hopefully you'll get something useful out of it.
