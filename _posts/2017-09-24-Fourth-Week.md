title: Week 4 - Too much to name
---

"What I've done"? 
---
Before the week began, I thought I'd get crushed since my week was packed with 7+ interviews. However, everything actually turned out to be quite fun. After having too much stress for a prolonged time, my brain started to develop some mechanism that blocks all the nerves and I was able to brush off any anxiety with much ease. 

Anyway, I came to interviews thinking I was just having conversations with random strangers and didn't take them as seriously as I usually did. This counter-intuitive mentality, surprisingly, helped me get through the week and already resulted in some good fruits so far.

Besides interviewing, I spent my time tweaking and testing my Information Retrieval algorithm to incorporate the token count of a query to the basic TF-IDF formula, implementing IDA* for AI class and teaming up with classmates to knock down SWE's second project.

What's in my way?

First comes deployment environment configuration.

The pain began setting things up for my IR class. I struggled for two days scratching my head wondering why one particular class I wrote failed to run, while all other classes in the same folder worked perfectly. Apart from that, although those files ran, they produced different results compared to the sample output my professor gave.

But the pain didn't end there. 

The worst part was configuring SWE's IDB project. I personally haven't touched React, Flask and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) before, so it took a lot of time to figure out what was going on. I spent a lot of time finding the best Flask/React boilerplate repository to use, creating the Docker image containing the full stack, deploying a sample app on GCP, as well as brainstorming ideas and looking for APIs to pull data from. This has yet to do with serving data, and I wonder how much worse it is going to be once we start to add database stuff in.

There's a lot more on what's in my way, but since I don't have time, I'll just list them out here without getting into too much detail: 

1. My IR formula doesn't, and I have no idea why :'(
2. An insane number of coding challenges to be completed
3. Scheduling and doing interviews
4. A 2500-word technical report and a completely blank API documentation.
5. Readingssss

Plan for next week

To be honest, I'm kind of clueless about how to proceed on from here.

My experience of the class
---

I fail to see the connection between the lectures and the assignments. Why do we study Python operators in class get grandiose web dev project with absolute no instruction/guidance and a bunch of irrelevant requirements?

Tips of the week 
---
Get 8 hours of sleep each day. 
Eat good food. 
Talk to friends and family.  
Exercise and meditate.
Remember there's more to life than just work and school.
