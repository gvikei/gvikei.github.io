"What I've done"? 
---

First week with no travels after a long time. I honestly can't remember how the week was gone, due to lack of sleep and other events in my personal life, but I've been much happier recently.

I greatly enjoyed the Ethics lesson with the guest lecturers. The whole lecture was engaging, and I was blown to know that it is possible to quantify ethical/moral issues using Mathematics formulas.

Over the week, I implemented a web spider and the PageRank algorithm then incorporating everything into an Inverted Index system for my Information Retrieval class' assignment.

The weekend and the beginning of this week, I have been working on my Artificial Intelligence project, for which I'm asked to use Bayes classification to identify individual objects in OpenNERO.

What's in my way?

What's been taught in class recently. I find myself failing quizzes more often than not, and I can't seem to identify the core ideas of what prof Downing wants to convey. 

Plan for next week
---

Re-read the first Chapter of Fowler's Refactoring book to solidify the concepts. Practice implementing what's been taught in class recently, especially on the SQL and Design Pattern stuff.  Cram some AI concepts if possible. Travel out of town & enjoy my weekend a bit, then work on the IDB website. 

My experience of the class

Pretty much as always: a good mix of joy, confusion and exhaustion.
