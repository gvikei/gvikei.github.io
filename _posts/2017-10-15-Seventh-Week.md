"What I've done"? 
---

I joggled through the week not really aware of what happened as there were so many things happened. Having 2 projects due in the week that I had a two-day onsite following by an exam was not anything fun. 

The highlight of the week was that I had the chance to meet so many great people on my on-site. Having engaging conversations on different topics from life to tech to religion with super smart and talented people was such a valuable refresher that I truly appreciate. 

What's in my way?
---

The upcoming week is even more brutal with 2 exams and 2 on-sites. While I enjoy having (free) short-trips out of town, they are also annoying in the sense that I have to be absent from all my classes and also not having enough time to do what I need to do. Beside, menstruation and all its side-effects completely wreck me.

Plan for next week
---

Sleep. Work. Pray. Repeat.

My experience of the class
---

Now that we're onto the more functional and unique parts of Python, things get more interesting but also challenging. Personally, I haven't had the opportunity to practice much or dive deep into what we learn recently, so the materials seem to be a bit hard for me right now.

Tips of the week 
---
I found this super eye-opening video on Zipf's law while studying for my Information Retrieval exam. Zipf's law is a (mysterious) law that applies to many aspects of life, from word frequency in languages, population distribution among the cities to wealth disparity. Much of the coolness of this law excellently explained in the video below.

Another video that I want to share this week is this inspirational commencement from the son of a third-grade dropout. I usually don't buy the "motivational" videos floating on my newsfeed, but this one made the exception.
