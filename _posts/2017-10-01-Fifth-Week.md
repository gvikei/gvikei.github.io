title: Week 5 - When all is said and done
---

"What I've done"? 
---
The whole week was a blur until Thursday when I finally submitted all projects for my 3 CS classes. SWE's IDB definitely took a significant amount of time, since there were a lot of requirements to fulfill. 

On Friday, after bumping into professor Downing in the elevator and having a brief conversation on competitive programming (CP), I decided to compete in the weekly contest. Retiring from CP for years definitely had its hold on me, especially when it comes to reading long problems and implementing bug-free solutions. I was really disappointed in the sense that I misread one of the problems and spent quite a lot of time debugging another (very) easy problem. However, it was still a lucky day that I secured the 3rd place and won the raffle prize at the end.

What's in my way?
---

The amount of material to digest from my Information Retrieval (IR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) classes. It just came to my realization that the difficulty of those classes increases pretty quickly over a short span of time while I haven't studied as much as I should have.

I'm also having interviews with some companies that often ask very hard questions. Due to the fact that I dedicated most of my week to school work but not much interview prep, I'm pretty worried that I'm just going to blow up those interviews.

Plan for next week
---

Pick up some React to prepare for the upcoming phases of the IDB project, re-study IR/AI concepts and get a head start on the assignments. Most importantly, practice for the interviews as much as I can.

My experience of the class
---

While learning about the different nuances of Python (and programming languages in general) is pretty intriguing, I'd love to see more of Software Engineering concepts and practices being taught in the class since they are what I initially signed up for. The materials for this class are easy to learn, despite being tricky sometimes. 

While I was able to pull off the project before the deadline, there were a lot of trials and errors in between since the project description was demanding yet super vague. I felt like lots of time could be saved if there were a high-level guideline of what steps are to be done. 

For example, nowhere in the project description required Python 3 to be used,  so our team went with Python 2.7 at first because it deploys much faster on Google App Engine. However, only a few days before the deadline we saw a comment on Piazza stating the project must be written in Python 3, so we had to start everything all over again. That was a very frustrating experience since we could as well missed that Piazza comment and our 1st project grade will surely suffer.
