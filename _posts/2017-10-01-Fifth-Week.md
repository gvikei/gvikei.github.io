title: Week 5 - When all is said and done
---

"What I've done"? 
---
The whole week was a blur until Thursday when I finally submitted all projects for my 3 CS classes. SWE's IDB definitely took a siginificant amount of time, since there were a lot of requirements to fulfill. 

On Friday, after bumping into professor Downing in the elevator and having a brief conversation on competitive programming, I decided to compete in the weekly contest after retiring for a looonggg time and luckily won some prize.

What's in my way?
---

The amount of materials to digest from my Information Retrieval and AI classes. It just came to my realization that the difficulty of those classes increases pretty quickly over a short span of time. I'm also having interviews with some companies  known for asking very hard questions, but since I dedicated most of my week to school work and not much interview prep, I'm pretty worried that I'm just going to blow up those interviews.

Plan for next week
---

Re-study IR and AI concepts, get a head start on my programming projects and practice for the interviews as much as I can.

My experience of the class
---

While learning about the different nuances of Python (and programming languages in general) is pretty intriguing, I'd love to see more of Software Engineering concepts and practices being taught in the class, since they are what I signed up for.

Tips of the week
