"What I've done"? 
---

I had my last onsite the beginning of the week, and a lot of surprises have happened to me since.

For SWE, finished the project on time, but deployment was a nightmare. Apart from that, I and a few other team members restructured the code to make things cleaner and more readable to graders.


I've also been working on my Information Retrieval assignment, for which I will be implementing a web spider that crawls all the links from a given starting URL, compute the PageRank for each visited document, then create an inverted index system that would incorporate the PageRank results to form a simple search engine like Google.

What's in my way?
---

My AI class. I've been skipping class quite too much, partly because of onsites, but mostly because I just can't follow the instructor. I think I need to seriously restudy everything for  this class, given the fact that it's pretty close to the end of the semester. 

Plan for next week
---

I plan to see prof Downing this Friday to clarify the parts that I feel cloudy about. I'm also seeing my IR & AI prof for discussion on the exams.

My experience of the class
---

I wish there were a more interactive way to learn what's been taught recently in class. I never liked SQL before, and I don't think the situation has improved after a few lectures into it. 

What is more, I find it hard to actually get the gist or the big ideas of what prof Downing is trying to convey in the recent Design Pattern lectures. Everything feels super vague/abstract, and I can't be sure whether my understanding of the concepts discussed is correct.

Tips of the week

If your team is running out of Educational Grant GCP credit, simply create a new Google account and join the trial GCP program and have your project deploy there. GCP happens to give out $300 right of the bat to new users.

Also, as we touched on Travis CI at the beginning of the class, I think it would be much better if we could have the project being automatically deployed to GCP if a new Docker image is built successfully. Thus, if you happen to be looking for something like this, the following article might be a good start.
