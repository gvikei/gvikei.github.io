"What I've done"? 
---

Most of what I did this week boils down to three things: talking to companies, doing interviews and working on the Collatz project. 

On **Monday**, I talked to a company that I've been exchanging emails with. 
**Tuesday** I had a follow-up phone interview with a company that I was referred to and later went to Bloomberg's tech talk. **Wednesday**, I had another on-campus interview that I heard good news from later in the evening, and also went to Dropbox's interview workshop. **Thursday morning**, I went to the Friends of Computer Science (FoCS)'s Career Brunch, which is an exclusive event for a small group of students within the CS department to network with partnering companies. I was so happy to see my favorite TA there again, especially when he was recruiting for a company that I'm interviewing with. **Thursday evening** was the College of Natural Science's Career Fair, which cost me 5 hours and a lot of energy, but I'm not complaining since I've got the interviews that I wanted in return. After the Career Fair, I went straight to the CS lab to work on Collatz since it was also due on that day. **Friday** was a bit more relaxing. Apart from class, I attended Quora's then Uber's tech talks and learned a lot cool new things. I also visited my doctor to do a quick check-up on a chronic illness that I have that evening.


What's in my way?
---

Anemia, cramps, backaches and mood swing (due to menstruation). I got to experience those symptoms multiple times each day this week. My ability to focus significantly decreased and I felt exhausted throughout the day. This also negatively impacted my immune system, which resulted in a not-yet-ended fever and fever blister. 

Plan for next week
---

Planning is actually the most tricky part. I'm having at least 4 interviews next week, along with coding challenges, classes, assignments and other personal duties to fulfill. So far, school has taken a lot of the time I usually dedicated for interview prep, which worries me the most. Of course, I can always cram multiple interviews within a day. However, that's pretty the best way to fail everything, including interviews and classes. Therefore, my plan for next week is to fit everything into my schedule in the most reasonable way.

My experience of the class
---

My experience of the class has been much better recently. Part of the reason is that I've gone through the first project, and now the [40-something-bullet-point workflow](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/Workflow.html) has started to make more sense. I also greatly enjoy professor Downing's lectures thanks to the novel pieces of knowledge and especially his excellent verbal skills. 

In terms of programming assignments, I wish the requirements were less tedious and confusing. For example, I just don't get why students have to open exactly 15 issues on Github *before* touching any code. Not only this is unnatural but it also creates a bad habit of making things up just to fulfill the requirements, rather than actually seeing the need to keep track of tasks/bugs or learning how *collaboratively* resolving issues using VCS.

Tips of the week 
---

1. **Attend tech talks**. There are so many good ones hosted in the department. They'll open your mind, fill your stomach, save your energy and lead to you lands of opportunities.

2. One very unusual tip that a Uber recruiter shared that I think many undergraduate students will benefit from: **stop going to hackathons**. Not that hackathons are bad, but data learned from thousands of applicants have shown there's no correlation between winning hackathon prizes and interview/job performance. The strongest applicants are the ones that go to competitive programming competitions (and win), not hackathons. Of course, one size doesn't fit all (especially for those companies that are more interested in having candidates can contribute immediately). However, given the fact that most tech interviews now are algorithmic problem solving, stop attending hackathons and do more practice problem instead seems to be a better way to ace your next interviews.
