"What I've done"? 
---

I picked up some React as planned last week and converted a small part of our currently-static-website to a more dynamic version. Our team didn't meet in person a lot this week because most of the tasks can be done remotely. We also divided our group into a back-end group and a front-end group to execute faster with less overhead.

As my AI class project is to modify a given implementation to solve the 3-disk version of the Tower of Hanoi problem, I spent some time writing the DFS solution from scratch (although this wasn't required) as I believe this would solidify my understanding and make things easier than directly implementing the solution inside someone else's code.

It was a busy week as I also had 5 interviews apart from classes and assignments. If anything I learned from these interviews, it'd be Java isn't a good choice for implementing-heavy problems under a tight time constraint, simply because of its verbosity and static-typed nature.

What's in my way?

I have a lot to do in the next 5 days: 1 interview, 2 projects, an out-of-town trip during the week, and one exam right after. Not having enough time to be well-prepared for all these is stressing the heck out of me.

Survive.

My experience of the class
---

I got to appreciate what professor Downing taught while debugging my implementation for the Tower of Hanoi problem.

Previously, I had always thought Python was much easier compared to other "real" programming languages like Java or C++. Yet, I stumbled over a deceptively nasty bug while just doing simple DFS. Without the knowledge of immutability of different Python objects from in this class, I don't think I wouldn't have figured out why my program was running incorrectly.

On the other hand, I am really thankful for prof Downing's supportiveness and flexibility when one of my on-sites happens to overlap with the class schedule. It was beyond my expectation that he agreed to provide extra accommodation, which would rarely be the case with other professors.

Tips of the week 
---
I frequently experience extreme exhaustions throughout the day and I don't really know what causes them. But since I'm getting roughly 7 hours of sleep a night and exercise weekly, I think it has to do with myself not eating healthily enough. 

So I did myself a favor last week by purchasing and using herbal supplements, namely [Hawaiian Spirulina](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039ITKRY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1) and [Gingko Biloba extract](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071RY61KV/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1). They didn't fail me at all, and I have been able to focus and think with clarity for 5+ hours straight at night, which never happened before and I thankfully got more work done. I would recommend giving them a try if there's too much on your plate and you just find yourself running out of energy.
