title: Week 2 - College life kicks in!
---

I had always wanted to have a personal space online where I can share and discuss things that I think areinteresting. However, due to privacy concerns, I had put off this idea for so long and instead kept a private blog for myself.

Fortunately, thanks to the CS373 (Software Engineering) course that I'm taking at school, I will be writing and publishing entries here weekly as to fulfill its requirements. My main focus for this blog will be the (technical) pieces of knowledge that I've learned in the class, at school, on the Internet, and from other people.

I have a huge


What's in my way?

Reading in a language that is not my mother tounge (which is English in my case) is such a pain. 

It takes me so long to finish a chapter for the Government class, and I can barely understand or recall much of what I have gone through (sad).

I'm not sure if my reading comprehension is hindering me, but for now I have trouble following the Collatz project statement as well.

Plan for next week

Knock as many things on my Trello's to-do list down as possible.

Tips of the week 
---

Last week my focus was on interview prep. This week I'll be giving my 2 cents on books and papers.

First off, synchronization stuff. I think I've always have troubles both with reading thick Operating System textbooks and solving synchronization problems. Thus, this [Little Book of Semaphore](http://greenteapress.com/semaphores/LittleBookOfSemaphores.pdf) is truly a hidden gem in the sense that it is fun to read and at the same time covers lots of synch. problems that most textbooks won't bother to dive that deep.

While going through the assigned readings for next week on Software Methodologies, I spent some time reflected on the methodologies practiced at the companies that I worked for (Google vs. Dun & Bradstreet), and compared them to the Extreme Programming practice introduced in the class. This led me to search for what the exact kind of software development framework used at Google since I personally never heard the words Scrum/Agile mentioned in my past 2 internships there. Anyway, if you are curious, everything you want to know is discussed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01715v2.pdf) which was written by a Google engineer very recently.

Lastly, for some reason, I never knew the CS department at UT has a website containing tons of good videos on CS at https://video.cs.utexas.edu/ until my senior year. Don't be like me! Take advantage of this very good resource to gain a depper understanding of not only the field but also our awesome professors before graduate. The topics covered here range from Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision to Robotics and Quantum Computing, so you'll be assured to come out pretty well-rounded!
