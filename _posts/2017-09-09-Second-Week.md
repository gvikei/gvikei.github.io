title: Week 2 - College life kicks in!
---

This week I start to feel the stress of college life when recruiting, career fair, events, assigments and classes get more intense and happen all at once.


"What I've done" (this past week)
---

Sorry, I just don't feel comfortable going through what I did throughout the week because I'm afraid I'll be accidentally disclosing personal info that shouldn't be on the Internet, so I won't write much on this.

On the flip side, in an attempt to de-stress and balance myself because being too techie is unhealthy, I watched 2 seriously good wartime movies namely ["Nostalgia for the Countryside"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117204/) and ["When the Tenth Month Comes"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118148/), all by Dang Nhat Minh - one of Vietnam's greatest directors ever.

The movies showed me the lost traditions of my people that I never knew of, and above all, how beautiful it is to have patriotism, sympathy, faithfulness and kindness being practiced widely and deliberately by all individuals within a community. I was deeply touched by how much one can sacrifice for others, by the highly artistic angle shots, and by the emotionally swaying poems brilliantly injected the in those movies.

What's in my way?
---

Reading in a language that is not my mother tongue (which is English in my case) is such a pain. It takes me so long to finish a chapter in the Government textbook, and at the end of the day, I don't recall much of what I have read. 

I'm not sure if my reading comprehension is what hindering me, but very often I find myself getting so confused while going through the workflow for the Collatz assignment.

Plan for next week
---

Knock as many things on my Trello's to-do list down as possible.


My experience of the class
---

I found this class to be strange. At one point, I start to worry that if my assumptions are true, then I might have put my efforts working on things that will not only consume a lot of my time but also skew my perception. I could elaborate more on why I feel this way, but I think it's best to withhold my own opinions a bit longer and see how the class goes before jumping into the conclusion.


Tips of the week 
---

This week I'll be giving my 2 cents on CS/SWE books and papers.

First off, system stuff. I think I've always had trouble both with reading thick Operating System textbooks and solving synchronization problems. Thus, this [Little Book of Semaphore](http://greenteapress.com/semaphores/LittleBookOfSemaphores.pdf) is truly a hidden gem in the sense that it is entertaining to read and at the same time covers lots of synchronization problems that most textbooks won't bother to dive that deep. 

While going through the assigned readings for next week on [software development methodologies](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/newMethodology.html), I had a good time reflecting and comparing Extreme Programming - which is the focus of the class, to Scrum - which is practiced at the company I interned last summer. Above all, this process had me questioned what makes one company so successful and above the other? In my eyes, since Google is a giant in the tech field, I have tons of respect for what they've done to be so good at software engineering. However, I don't recall hearing the words "Agile", "Scrum" or "Extreme Programming" being mentioned very often when I interned there, which had me googled what Google used for their development process (pun intended). I haven't had enough time to read and come to a conclusion on this topic, however, I found a very enjoyable [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01715v2.pdf) on software engineering practices done at Google, written by an engineer who worked there for about 10 years just recently.

Lastly, for some reason, I never knew the CS department at UT has a website containing tons of good videos on CS at https://video.cs.utexas.edu/ until my senior year. Don't be like me! Take advantage of this very good resource to gain a deeper understanding of not only the field but also our awesome professors before graduate. The topics covered here range from Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision to Robotics and Quantum Computing, so you'll be assured to come out pretty well-rounded!
